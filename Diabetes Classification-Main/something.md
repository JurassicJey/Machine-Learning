This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing a diabetes dataset. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, visualization, and insights extraction.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Reads the `diabetes.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Checks for missing values and provides a summary of missing data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizes the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
   - Displays the distribution of the target variable (`Outcome`).

4. **Insights Extraction**:
   - Provides statistics and insights about the dataset, including the distribution of outcomes.
